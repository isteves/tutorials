This is where I write out tutorials for my future self and other R users who may not be familiar with the command line, Python, and other non-R coding.

Here are some topics covered so far (others in progress):

- [Zipping files on the server](https://isteves.github.io/tutorials/zipping-large-files) - how to zip and unzip files (on the datateam server) using the command line; also features `tmux` to unzip in _parallel_
- [Intro to Python and the Command Line](https://isteves.github.io/tutorials/command_line_python) - wherein I record my very long Slack walk-through in sentences; involves unzipping, running Python 2 script, exploring data in Python, and saving dataframes to csv's :panda_face:
- [Fo(u)ray into data frames and arrays in Python](https://isteves.github.io/tutorials/python_arrays_dataframes) - 4 lessons I learned while trying to use Python arrays/data frames
- [GitHub email privacy](https://isteves.github.io/tutorials/github_email_privacy) - what I learned when I tried to use remove my personal email from GitHub
- [Extracting attribute metadata using R](https://isteves.github.io/tutorials/attributes_eml_to_csv) - a tutorial for getting a csv of attribute information from the Arctic Data Center/EML in general; may have now been obsoleted by a function
