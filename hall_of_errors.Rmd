This is where I'm collecting the various confusing error messages I encounter, and how I ultimately resolve them!

## R

**Error:** When running `devtools::check()` and this error shows up: "Running the tests in ‘tests/test_xxx.R’ failed...could not find function"

**Solution:** The test file is in the wrong place! It needs to be in 'test/testthat/test_xxx.R'.

## Git/GitHub

**Error:** `git pull upstream master` fails. This command is used to update the master branch of your fork with whatever is on the master branch of the original repository

```
fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

**Solution:** Use `git remote add upstream URL` so that git knows what your upstream is. For some reason, this error occurs inconsistently on forked repos

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NCEAS/datateam-training
git pull upstream master
```
