git checkout master (switch to your master branch)
git pull upstream master (pull all commits from NCEAS/datamgmt that you don't have)
git push origin master (push your updated local version of master to your fork on github)
git checkout isteves-get_awards (switch to this branch)

## Kill sessions
How to kill sessions via the command line.

From [Dominic](https://github.com/dmullen17):

```
killall -u username rsession
```

## tmux
How to use tmux to run processes in parallel.

From [Dominic](https://github.com/dmullen17):

```
Multiple sessions:  
1. Open terminal 
2. "ssh username@datateam.nceas.ucsb.edu" 
3. Use tmux to open multiple sessions 
    1. "tmux new -s session_name" 
4. "R" will open an instance of R 
5. Load libraries and dependencies - i like to put everything I need in a file I can source ("source("/home/dmullen/terminal_deps.R")
6. Run whatever code you need to run 
7. Close the window (everything running keeps going).  "ctrl+b, followed by d"
    1. "ctrl+b" has a bunch of different follow up options when using tmux 
8. "tmux a -t session_name"  - re-open a running session 
9. "tmux ls" list your running sessions 
10. "tmux kill-session -t session_name" - close a session 
```
