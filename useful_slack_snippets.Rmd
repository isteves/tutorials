## NetCDF's

How to read in NetCDF's to R.

From [Sharis](https://github.com/sharisochs):

```{r eval = FALSE}
t <- nc_open('~/local_erddap/dataset/ct/Commercial_Harvest_by_District/distinct.nc')
test <- ncvar_get(t, 'WholeLbs')
```

## Git
How to update a master branch and then merge updates into a fork.

From [Dominic](https://github.com/dmullen17):

```
git checkout master (switch to your master branch)
git pull upstream master (pull all commits from NCEAS/datamgmt that you don't have)
git push origin master (push your updated local version of master to your fork on github)
git checkout isteves-get_awards (switch to this branch) 
git merge master (merge all commits from master into your branch)
git push origin isteves-get_awards (push your branch to a branch on your fork on github
```

## Member nodes
Accessing KNB test/development node.

From [Bryce](https://github.com/amoeba):

```
# knb dev
mn <- MNode("https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/knb/d1/mn/v2")
```

## Kill sessions
How to kill sessions via the command line.

From [Dominic](https://github.com/dmullen17):

```
killall -u username rsession
```

## tmux
How to use tmux to run processes in parallel.

From [Dominic](https://github.com/dmullen17):

```
Multiple sessions:  
1. Open terminal 
2. "ssh username@datateam.nceas.ucsb.edu" 
3. Use tmux to open multiple sessions 
    1. "tmux new -s session_name" 
4. "R" will open an instance of R 
5. Load libraries and dependencies - i like to put everything I need in a file I can source ("source("/home/dmullen/terminal_deps.R")
6. Run whatever code you need to run 
7. Close the window (everything running keeps going).  "ctrl+b, followed by d"
    1. "ctrl+b" has a bunch of different follow up options when using tmux 
8. "tmux a -t session_name"  - re-open a running session 
9. "tmux ls" list your running sessions 
10. "tmux kill-session -t session_name" - close a session 
```

## Get nested packages with recursive functions

From [Mitchell](https://github.com/maier-m):

```
cn <- dataone::CNode('PROD')
mn <- dataone::getMNode(cn,'urn:node:ARCTIC')
rm_pid <- " resourceMap_arctic-data.14753.2"


getStructure <- function(mn, rm_pid) {

print(rm_pid)
    
# Initialize Structure
root <- data.tree::Node$new(rm_pid)

# Query
pid_esc <- stringi::stri_replace_all_fixed(rm_pid, ":", "\\:")
query_params <- list(q = paste0("resourceMap:", pid_esc),
                     rows = 1000,
                     fl = "identifier,formatType")
response <- dataone::query(mn, query_params, as = "list")

for (x in response) {
    
    if (x$formatType == "RESOURCE") {
        node <- getStructure(mn, x$identifier)
        root$AddChildNode(node)
    }
    
}

return(root)

}

out <- getStructure(mn, rm_pid)


tree_list <- data.tree::ToListExplicit(out, unname = TRUE)
networkD3::diagonalNetwork(tree_list)
```
